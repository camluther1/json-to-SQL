# json-to-SQL
Program that processes JSON files and enters them into SQL database.

The following program here will automatically generate a SQL database and load the data from the roster_data.json file into it. 
Note - you'll need some sort of SQLite viewer to look at the result. Additionally, you should be sure to store the JSON file and the python file in the same directory.
